# 2-DOF-robotic-arm
This is a step-by-step guide on how to build a basic robotic arm.
This project will provide you with the following details:
1) What to buy and how to assemble the mechanical components
2) How to program the microcontroller and how to connect it to the whole robotic arm
3) How to calculate angles and integrate them in the code to make the arm move
4) How to link the arm with your device via Bluetooth and how the LCD will display the angles and movements.
